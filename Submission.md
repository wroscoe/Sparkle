SparkleSlap is a tool for parents to motivate their kids to learn (initially about bitcoin and lightning).

#### Problem:
Parents want their kids to be prepared for the future but kids just want to play.
Also, it's not easy for kids to spend money on the internet because of creditcard age restrictions.

#### Solution:
A tool that lets parents fund quizes on topics they want their kids to learn about. When the kid completes the quiz they recieve bitcoin via the lightning network that they can spend.

#### Rational for focusing on kids.
Kids are the future of bitcoin. If their first experience buying something online is with lightning, any future transaction having to give up your identity to buy something is going to seem archaic. this will drive adoption.
